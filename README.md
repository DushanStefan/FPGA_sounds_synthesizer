# FPGA Sound Synthesizer

**Digital Sound Generator System on FPGA with VGA and 7-Segment Display Integration**

---

### Description of the Project Idea
This project is a digital sound generator system implemented on an FPGA. It integrates sound synthesis, VGA output, and 7-segment display control for an interactive musical experience. The goal is to create a platform that produces various musical notes based on user input, offering visual feedback on a VGA monitor and a 7-segment display. Users can select notes, octaves, and modes, which are converted into sound signals using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This synthesis method generates different tones by adjusting the output signal's frequency and duty cycle, which plays through an external speaker. The project also includes a VGA controller for real-time graphics that represent selected notes and modes, alongside a 7-segment display showing the current note, octave, and mode clearly. The FPGA design ensures real-time operation and synchronization between sound and display outputs, providing a seamless user experience.

### Overall Design / Modular Architecture of the System

#### Input Interfaces

The input interfaces of the **Digital Sound Generator** allow users to define the musical characteristics, such as notes, octaves, and sound modes. These interfaces are essential for controlling the behavior of the system and enabling the generation of customized sound outputs. Below is an overview of the input interfaces and their functionalities

1. **Notes**  
   - **Type**: 12-bit vector  
   - **Description**: Each bit in the 12-bit vector corresponds to one of the 12 musical notes in an octave, ranging from **C** to **B**. When a specific bit is set to `1`, the system interprets it as the activation of the respective note.  
   - **Functionality**: Enables users to select the musical notes they want to play. Multiple notes can be activated simultaneously for chord synthesis.

2. **Octaves**  
   - **Type**: 3-bit vector  
   - **Description**: Represents the octave range, allowing users to specify which octave (0â€“7) the selected notes belong to.  
   - **Functionality**: Changes the pitch of the notes, shifting them higher or lower across octaves. This ensures versatility in creating sounds ranging from bass to treble.  

3. **Modes**  
   - **Type**: 5-bit vector  
   - **Description**: Each bit or combination of bits corresponds to a specific wave type or sound mode, such as **sine**, **square**, **triangle**, or custom waves.  
   - **Functionality**: Defines the waveform used for sound synthesis, allowing the user to change the tonal quality and texture of the generated sound.

These input interfaces work in unison to provide a rich and flexible platform for audio synthesis, enabling users to produce dynamic musical compositions through simple and intuitive control signals.


#### Output Interfaces

The **Digital Sound Generator** provides multiple output interfaces to deliver audio and visual feedback to users. These outputs are crucial for interpreting the system's functionality and engagingly presenting the results. Below are the details of each output interface:

1. **Audio Output**  
   - **Type**: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal  
   - **Description**: The system generates sound by producing a PWM signal, which is then fed to a speaker. The frequency and waveform of the signal are determined by the selected notes, octaves, and modes.  
   - **Functionality**: Converts digital inputs into audible sound, enabling real-time audio synthesis.  

2. **7-Segment Display**  
   - **Type**: 4-digit display  
   - **Description**: Displays information such as the current note, octave, and mode selection. Each digit represents a specific parameter to provide an overview of the system's current state.  
   - **Functionality**: Offers a user-friendly way to monitor the system's operation and ensure accurate input selection.  

3. **VGA Output**  
   - **Components**:  
     - **Horizontal Sync (hsync)**: Synchronizes the display's horizontal scan.  
     - **Vertical Sync (vsync)**: Synchronizes the display's vertical refresh rate.  
     - **RGB Color Signals**: 4-bit per channel for red, green, and blue colors, allowing the generation of up to 4,096 unique colors.  
   - **Description**: Provides a graphical representation of the sound synthesis process, displaying information like waveforms, notes, and modes on a VGA monitor.  
   - **Functionality**: Enhances the user experience by offering a visual representation of audio outputs and system activity.

These output interfaces collectively enable users to interact with the system effectively, delivering both auditory and visual feedback for a comprehensive experience.
