# FPGA Sound Synthesizer

**Digital Sound Generator System on FPGA with VGA and 7-Segment Display Integration**

---

### Description of the Project Idea
This project is a digital sound generator system implemented on an FPGA. It integrates sound synthesis, VGA output, and 7-segment display control for an interactive musical experience. The goal is to create a platform that produces various musical notes based on user input, offering visual feedback on a VGA monitor and a 7-segment display. Users can select notes, octaves, and modes, which are converted into sound signals using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This synthesis method generates different tones by adjusting the output signal's frequency and duty cycle, which plays through an external speaker. The project also includes a VGA controller for real-time graphics that represent selected notes and modes, alongside a 7-segment display showing the current note, octave, and mode clearly. The FPGA design ensures real-time operation and synchronization between sound and display outputs, providing a seamless user experience.

### Overall Design / Modular Architecture of the System

#### Input Interfaces

The input interfaces of the **Digital Sound Generator** allow users to define the musical characteristics, such as notes, octaves, and sound modes. These interfaces are essential for controlling the behavior of the system and enabling the generation of customized sound outputs. Below is an overview of the input interfaces and their functionalities

1. **Notes**  
   - **Type**: 12-bit vector  
   - **Description**: Each bit in the 12-bit vector corresponds to one of the 12 musical notes in an octave, ranging from **C** to **B**. When a specific bit is set to `1`, the system interprets it as the activation of the respective note.  
   - **Functionality**: Enables users to select the musical notes they want to play. Multiple notes can be activated simultaneously for chord synthesis.

2. **Octaves**  
   - **Type**: 3-bit vector  
   - **Description**: Represents the octave range, allowing users to specify which octave (0â€“7) the selected notes belong to.  
   - **Functionality**: Changes the pitch of the notes, shifting them higher or lower across octaves. This ensures versatility in creating sounds ranging from bass to treble.  

3. **Modes**  
   - **Type**: 5-bit vector  
   - **Description**: Each bit or combination of bits corresponds to a specific wave type or sound mode, such as **sine**, **square**, **triangle**, or custom waves.  
   - **Functionality**: Defines the waveform used for sound synthesis, allowing the user to change the tonal quality and texture of the generated sound.

These input interfaces work in unison to provide a rich and flexible platform for audio synthesis, enabling users to produce dynamic musical compositions through simple and intuitive control signals.


#### Output Interfaces

The **Digital Sound Generator** provides multiple output interfaces to deliver audio and visual feedback to users. These outputs are crucial for interpreting the system's functionality and engagingly presenting the results. Below are the details of each output interface:

1. **Audio Output**  
   - **Type**: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal  
   - **Description**: The system generates sound by producing a PWM signal, which is then fed to a speaker. The frequency and waveform of the signal are determined by the selected notes, octaves, and modes.  
   - **Functionality**: Converts digital inputs into audible sound, enabling real-time audio synthesis.  

2. **7-Segment Display**  
   - **Type**: 4-digit display  
   - **Description**: Displays information such as the current note, octave, and mode selection. Each digit represents a specific parameter to provide an overview of the system's current state.  
   - **Functionality**: Offers a user-friendly way to monitor the system's operation and ensure accurate input selection.  

3. **VGA Output**  
   - **Components**:  
     - **clk**: Clock signal driving the VGA controller and synchronizing all operations.  
     - **notes**: A 12-bit input specifying the active musical notes for visual representation. 
     - **octaves**: A 3-bit input defining the octave range of the active notes.
     - **hsync & vsync**: Output synchronization signals for horizontal and vertical scanning.
     - **RGB Outputs (red, green, blue)**: 4-bit color signals used to generate the display colors on the VGA monitor.
   - **Description**:Integrates the VGA synchronization and drawing logic. It serves as the main interface for the VGA display system, connecting the clock and input signals (notes and octaves) to the submodules and outputting synchronization signals (hsync and vsync) along with RGB color values.  
   - **Functionality**: Ensures proper timing and alignment of the active display region, and creates a dynamic grid of colors that visualize the notes and octaves. Together, they produce a visually engaging and synchronized display for the sound synthesis process.

These output interfaces collectively enable users to interact with the system effectively, delivering both auditory and visual feedback for a comprehensive experience.

### Discussion
The primary objective of this project was to create a sound-generating system using a Basys3 FPGA board and VHDL programming. The system employs Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to generate tones, and button inputs allow the user to control the sound frequencies. The implementation successfully generated variable-frequency PWM signals based on button inputs, enabling distinct tones to be produced. The key modules included a clock divider to reduce the 100 MHz system clock for tone generation, a PWM generator for square wave production, and button control logic to map user inputs to specific frequencies. Observations revealed the designâ€™s ability to produce audible sounds, with accurate pin mapping and responsive user controls enhancing functionality.

Several challenges were encountered, notably the insufficient output voltage from the FPGAâ€™s GPIO pins to directly drive a speaker, resulting in low sound volume. Issues with pin assignments required careful verification and debugging complexities such as the absence of a free-running clock added to the implementation difficulties. To address these, incorporating an external amplifier is recommended to boost the signal and drive the speaker effectively. Additionally, integrating a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) for smoother sine waveforms and expanding the button logic to enable melody generation could significantly improve the systemâ€™s audio quality and functionality. Future developments could extend this work into educational tools, embedded audio systems, or signal processing applications, showcasing the versatility and potential of FPGA-based sound generation systems.
